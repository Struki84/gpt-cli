Short Bio (from simun.strukan.me):

Born 27th of Aprli 1984 in Zagreb, Croatia, to chemistry and physics university profesor (Dad), and biology and chemistry school teacher (Mom).

I attended elementary school and high school (Natural Science 5th Gymnasium) in Zagreb, where I also got my bachelors degree in mechanical engineering from Universty of Zagreb.

From dozens of hobbies and extra curricular activities at my early age the ones that stuck where my martial arts training namely wushu and western boxing, playing music (saxophone and guitar), 
and programming. On my senior year in college a really cool professor M. Essert PHD, took me under his wing and introduced me to the world of professional programming and development. 
Since then I've been learning and working my way from simple web applications to iOS swift mobile apps, over a span of 10 years. Combined with my very solid understanding of math and physics, 
I have become adept problem solver with more focus on problems than technology used to solve them.
