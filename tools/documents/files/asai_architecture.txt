Asai Architecture
---

Asai is AI Avatar proof of concept. Primarily written in GoLang it heavily relies on the [LangChain](https://langchain.com/) framework, specifically [LangChain-Go](https://github.com/tmc/langchaingo).

The backend of Asai consists of several microservices, including the engine service, the Discord service, and the app service.

The Discord and app services implement the Discord API and general web application functionalities, respectively.

The engine is the core service that handles all interactions with LLM (Language Models). Written in LangChain-Go, it is responsible for creating and managing various AI agents that perform multiple tasks. It also tracks user interactions by implementing long-term and agent memory.

As of the current implementation (Mon, 21 Aug 2023), there are several agents available:

- The main Asai engine is a conversational agent that converses directly with the user and manages the use of the system's agents and tools.
- The search agent uses several different search engines to look up information on the internet.
- The browser agent reads HTML pages.
- The library agent loads and reads documents and various data provided in the knowledge base library.

In addition, Asai has a web and mobile client in development.

The mobile app is expected to incorporate biometric readings and allow users to interact with the system through audio (speech).
